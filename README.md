# Advent of Code 2024 - Elixir
Solutions for AOC 2024.

This was a **learning** project. I am a Data Scientist and ML Engineer who used these exercises to learn:
 - Functional and immutable programming
 - Elixir language https://elixir-lang.org
 - Neovim editor https://neovim.io

The solutions are probabbly not optimal but manage to get the work done. Exercises 1 through 6 were inspired by Clojure solutions from https://github.com/bhauman/adv2024/tree/main/src/adv2024, the rest are original.
